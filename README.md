# RandomGen

Implement the method nextNum() and a minimal but effective set of unit tests. 

As a quick check, given Random Numbers are [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3] and Probabilities are [0.01, 0.3, 0.58, 0.1, 0.01] if we call nextNum() 100 times we may get the following results:
-1: 1 times
0: 22 times
1: 57 times
2: 20 times
3: 0 times
